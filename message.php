            <h3>Words from Principal</h3>
                <p>It is a matter of great pride and joy that Little Jewels Web site has been launched. A long cherished aim in reaching out to children worldwide has been accomplished. The oldest English Medium School in the country was founded in 1974 with an incomparable enthusiasm having 7 foreign children as the first group of students. The philosophy being ‘Read in the name of the Lord.’ We believe that the school is the lighthouse of society and therefore should provide direction and light not only to students but also to parents and society at large. National Curriculum in English Medium started from the year 2010. This was to facilitate learning for kids who desire to seek the National Curriculum designed by the government and is under the Shikha Board Chittagong. Within a short time our students have shown outstanding performance in PSC, JSC and SSC Exams held. Our first batch of students sat for SSC in 2016 showed brilliant results.</p>
