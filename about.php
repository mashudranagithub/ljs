                <h3>About LJS</h3>
                <p>Little Jewels was founded in 1974 as the first English medium school in response to the need for English Medium education. The school is from Play Group to ‘A’ Levels. The centre is created to give your children wonderful facilities to transform them into ‘Little Men’ or ‘Little Women’ and worthy citizens of their country. The institution is designed to provide an enlightened education based on sound moral principles. The aim of this institution is to impart sound education to form a praiseworthy character and to develop in the student habit of true discipline and self efficiency so as to enable them to become dutiful citizens. The school authorities welcome students of all creeds provided they agree to abide by the rules. The institution follows the syllabus of I.G.C.S.E. The course comprises all the usual branches of sound moral, intellectual and physical education, preparing the students to appear for O & A Levels offered by London University as well as Cambridge University.</p>
